# NANU - redesign and new stack

In this repository we are working on the redesign and the new stack for the website "NANU - Wandel-Wege entdecken". We want to have a project where we all can learn and create a more sustainable, secure, fast and beautiful website that the readers of NANU will love.

Just have a look into the issues and jump in discussing, thinking, dreaming and developing with us! We look forward to you and your contributions - and hope we can learn from each other.
